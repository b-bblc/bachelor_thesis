\section{Results}

In this section, we present the results of our analysis, structured in three parts. First, we describe the preprocessing and data quality control steps to ensure reliable comparisons. Next, we report descriptive corpus statistics and feature analyses that do not involve machine learning. Finally, we present the deeper results obtained through machine learning methods (classification and clustering) to address cross-linguistic EDU segmentation and pattern discovery.

\subsection{Preprocessing and Data Quality}

As an initial step, we performed data quality control on the collected corpora to remove noise that could skew the analysis. Using a three-sigma statistical rule combined with heuristic analysis, we identified and removed one anomalous 353-token EDU from the Russian dataset (consisting of bibliographic metadata) while retaining five legitimate complex EDUs. This minimal data cleaning ensured cross-linguistic corpus balance without sacrificing authentic discourse structures. Full details of the preprocessing procedure are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:preprocessing}.


\subsection{Corpus-Level Descriptive Analysis}

\subsubsection{Punctuation and Conjunctions as EDU Boundary Markers}

As the analysis of boundary markers shows, there are significant differences in how German and Russian utilise punctuation and conjunctions to segment discourse. Punctuation in particular emerges as a more prominent EDU boundary marker in Russian than in German. In German, punctuation accounts for about \textbf{13.0\%} of all tokens at EDU boundaries, whereas in Russian it accounts for \textbf{19.4\%}. This difference of 6.4 percentage points indicates that Russian relies more heavily on punctuation for discourse segmentation. Several factors may explain this gap. First, the Russian punctuation system mandates frequent use of commas and other delimiters to isolate syntactic constructions, which naturally increases their count at clause boundaries. Second, structural differences between the languages play a role: Russian's freer word order often requires punctuation to explicitly mark syntactic units and preserve clarity. Finally, stylistic differences in the corpora (genre, register) could influence the density and distribution of punctuation marks at EDU boundaries. Figure~\ref{fig:punctuation_analysis} illustrates these tendencies, comparing the proportion of EDUs ending in various punctuation marks for both languages.

    \label{fig:punctuation_analysis}
\end{figure}

Conjunctions serve as another primary cue for EDU boundaries, and their usage patterns are also revealing. \textbf{Coordinating conjunctions} (e.g., "and", "but") typically connect independent clauses or parallel segments, and the dependency relations \texttt{cc} (coordinating conjunction) and \texttt{conj} (conjunct) consistently coincide with EDU breaks in both languages. This suggests that coordination is a universal signal for discourse segmentation, marking transitions between related units. \textbf{Subordinating conjunctions}, on the other hand, introduce dependent clauses (e.g., causal or conditional clauses) that form separate EDUs providing background or conditional information relative to a main clause. These create hierarchical discourse structures and are likewise strong indicators of EDU boundaries. Despite typological differences between German and Russian, we observe remarkably similar behavior in how conjunctions mark boundaries: both languages adhere to general principles where conjunctions signal the onset of a new discourse unit, aiding text coherence and flow. Figure~\ref{fig:conjunction_analysis} highlights the frequency of conjunctive constructions at EDU boundaries in the two corpora, underscoring their parallel roles.

    \caption{Analysis of conjunctive constructions as EDU boundary markers. Both German and Russian show high frequencies of conjunctions at EDU boundaries, reflecting their universal role in connecting discourse segments.}
    \label{fig:conjunction_analysis}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Dependency Relations as Boundary Indicators}

Syntactic dependency structure provides additional cues for EDU boundaries. Strong boundary indicators include relations such as \texttt{conj}, \texttt{cc}, \texttt{advcl}, \texttt{ccomp}, and \texttt{xcomp}, which consistently align with discourse segmentation points. A chi-square analysis confirmed significant differences between German and Russian in the distribution of dependency relations at EDU boundaries ($p < 0.001$), indicating language-specific preferences within shared fundamental principles. Detailed analysis is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:dependency}.

\subsubsection{Position-Based Boundary Features}

Positional analysis revealed that boundary markers cluster near the beginning of sentences (first 20\% of token positions), aligning with theories of topicalisation and thematic progression. Additionally, greater dependency distance between syntactic heads and dependents correlates with higher boundary probability, supporting the interrelation between syntactic complexity and discourse segmentation. Full positional analysis is available in Appendix~\ref{app:position}.

\subsubsection{EDU Length Distribution Analysis}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/basic_edu_length_distribution_2_2.png}
\caption{EDU length distribution comparison after cleaning the Russian corpus: histogram, box plot, cumulative distribution, and descriptive statistics. The removal of anomalous data in Russian yields a smoother tail and improved cross-language comparability.}
\label{fig:edu_length_after_cleaning}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:edu_length_after_cleaning} presents a comprehensive analysis of Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) length distributions in the German and Russian corpora, using four complementary visualisations. We focus here on the cleaned data (after removing the extreme outlier from the Russian corpus), to ensure a fair comparison.

\textbf{Panel A: Histogram Comparison.} Both languages show a strong preference for short EDUs, with frequency dropping off as length increases (an approximately exponential decay). German EDUs (blue) have a sharp peak in the 1--5 token range. Russian EDUs (red) also peak at short lengths but exhibit a broader distribution with a less pronounced peak and a somewhat longer tail, indicating greater variability in how discourse may be segmented into EDUs.

\textbf{Panel B: Box Plot Distribution.} The German length distribution is more compact, with a median around 9 tokens and an interquartile range of roughly 6 to 14 tokens. Russian EDUs have a slightly higher median (around 11 tokens) and a wider spread. Even after cleaning, the Russian corpus shows more variability and a few longer EDUs (reflected in a longer whisker and some mild outliers in the box plot), although the most extreme case has been removed. The maximum observed EDU length in Russian dropped dramatically after removing the 353-token anomaly (now closer to the German maximum of 42 tokens), underscoring the improved comparability of the two datasets.

\textbf{Panel C: Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).} The CDF curves illustrate that German EDUs reach cumulative proportions more quickly at lower lengths: about 80\% of German EDUs are 15 tokens or shorter, whereas the 80\% mark for Russian EDUs extends to nearly 20 tokens. However, beyond the 90th percentile, the curves converge, suggesting that aside from the very longest outliers, both languages allow for similarly complex maximal units. In other words, once the extreme Russian anomaly is excluded, the upper-end lengths of EDUs in both languages become comparable.

\textbf{Panel D: Descriptive Statistics.} Key summary statistics (post-cleaning) include: German corpus (274 EDUs) with mean length $= 10.95$ tokens (SD $= 6.55$, max $= 42$); Russian corpus (234 EDUs after cleaning) with mean length $\approx 11.3$ tokens (SD $\approx 9.8$, max $= 43$). Both languages share an identical median EDU length of 9 tokens and a 75th-percentile value of 14 tokens, highlighting their similar central tendencies. The Russian mean and variance are slightly higher than German's, reflecting the broader distribution and remaining longer EDUs, but these differences are not large.

\textbf{Statistical Significance.} Despite visual differences in spread, statistical tests confirm no significant difference in EDU lengths between the two languages. A two-sample t-test yields $t = -1.17$, $p = 0.24$, and a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test returns $U = 34421$, $p = 0.18$ (both $p > 0.05$). These results hold true even when the extreme outlier was present and remain so after its removal, indicating that the underlying preferences for segment length are statistically comparable across German and Russian. The noticeable distributional differences are thus primarily due to variability and rare long segments rather than a fundamental length bias in one language versus the other.

\textbf{Interpretation.} The overall distribution patterns suggest that both languages adhere to discourse chunking constraints that favor cognitively manageable unit sizes. The similarity in medians and the lack of a statistical difference imply comparable norms of syntactic and discourse complexity in forming EDUs, likely influenced by genre (news/commentary) and general principles of information packaging. The presence of longer-tail behavior in Russian (even after cleaning) may reflect certain stylistic or syntactic practices (such as embedding multiple clauses in one sentence) that create longer discourse units. Furthermore, the identification and removal of the extreme Russian outlier underscores the importance of data cleaning in corpus linguistics: anomalies can inflate variance and create false impressions of difference, so ensuring high-quality data is crucial for accurate cross-linguistic comparisons.

\subsubsection{Part-of-Speech Distribution Analysis}

Cross-linguistic analysis of part-of-speech (POS) usage within EDUs reveals clear distinctions in how German and Russian construct their discourse units. For this comparison, we normalised POS counts by EDU length to obtain ratios (proportions of each POS per EDU), allowing us to compare languages despite differing EDU sizes. Figure~\ref{fig:pos_distribution} provides four perspectives on these POS ratios: the mean ratio per POS category for each language, a heatmap of POS distribution differences, box plots illustrating variability for select POS categories, and a table of t-test results for each POS.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/part_of_speech_distribution_analysis_2_4.png}
  \caption{Cross-linguistic POS distribution analysis for EDUs. Top-left: mean POS ratios (German vs. Russian); top-right: heatmap of POS usage differences; bottom-left: box plots for selected POS categories; bottom-right: significance of cross-linguistic differences (t-test $p$-values).}
  \label{fig:pos_distribution}
\end{figure}

The results show that Russian EDUs have a significantly higher concentration of nouns and adjectives, whereas German EDUs contain higher proportions of adverbs, pronouns, and determiners. Verb ratios are very similar between the two languages, suggesting that both German and Russian EDUs carry a comparable density of predicate verbs on average. Specifically, independent t-tests on the per-EDU POS ratios confirm highly significant differences ($p < 0.001$) in the following categories: noun ratio (higher in Russian), adjective ratio (higher in Russian), adverb ratio (higher in German), pronoun ratio (higher in German), and determiner ratio (higher in German). By contrast, differences in verb ratio are not statistically significant, and other categories like prepositions and conjunctions show minimal variation between languages.

These patterns align well with known typological contrasts between German and Russian. Russian, lacking articles and having a rich case system, tends to pack more information into nominal phrases—hence a higher noun and adjective density. German, on the other hand, uses articles (categorised as determiners) obligatorily, and often employs pronouns and adverbs (including pronominal adverbs) to maintain cohesion and referential clarity, leading to higher ratios of those parts of speech. The similar verb ratios indicate that both languages structure their EDUs around a comparable number of finite verbs, implying similar clause densities. In summary, while the core predicate structure of EDUs is consistent across languages, German and Russian differ in how they distribute descriptive and referential information (nominal vs. adverbial/pronominal), reflecting broader grammatical and stylistic differences.

\subsubsection{Syntactic Complexity Analysis}

Comparing syntactic complexity metrics (parse tree depth, dependency distance, finite verb count, punctuation ratio), we found that German and Russian EDUs exhibit broadly comparable complexity. Both languages show similar median values for hierarchical and linear complexity measures, with most EDUs containing one finite verb. The main difference appears in punctuation ratio dispersion, with Russian showing more variability due to stylistic and grammatical structuring differences. In summary, the languages maintain similar foundational predicative structures while distributing additional complexity through slightly different channels (nominal embedding in Russian vs. separate modifying elements in German). Detailed analysis is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:complexity}.

\subsection{Machine Learning Results and Pattern Discovery}

\subsubsection{Supervised EDU Boundary Classification}

In order to evaluate the feasibility of automatic discourse segmentation, we trained and tested machine learning models to detect EDU boundaries in our corpora. Two classification algorithms were compared: Logistic Regression and Random Forest, using features derived from the linguistic cues discussed above (e.g., dependency relations, part-of-speech tags, token positions). The Random Forest classifier consistently outperformed Logistic Regression in this task. Specifically, the Random Forest achieved F$_1$-scores of approximately 0.85 for German and 0.82 for Russian, compared to 0.75 (German) and 0.70 (Russian) with Logistic Regression. This superior performance of the ensemble method highlights its ability to capture non-linear interactions between features (for example, how certain combinations of POS tags and positions jointly signal a boundary).

Feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model reinforced our earlier observations about boundary predictors: dependency relations emerged as the strongest features for boundary detection, followed by positional features (such as whether a token appears early in the sentence or is a conjunction at clause-initial position) and then morphological features like part-of-speech tags (with distinctions between function words and content words proving informative). Another notable finding is the minimal performance gap between German and Russian (roughly 3 percentage points in F$_1$). This suggests that the feature patterns learned by the model generalise well across these typologically different languages. In practical terms, it supports the idea that a universal discourse segmentation approach is viable—one that can be adapted to different languages with only minor losses in accuracy. Overall, the strong performance of the classifiers indicates that the cues we analysed (punctuation, conjunctions, syntax, etc.) are not only theoretically significant but also practically useful for automated EDU boundary detection.

\subsubsection{Unsupervised Clustering of EDU Patterns}

As a complementary approach to the supervised analysis, we applied unsupervised clustering to the EDUs to discover common discourse patterns without pre-defined labels. We constructed standardised feature vectors for each EDU (including length, POS ratios, and syntactic complexity measures), applied PCA for dimensionality reduction (retaining 80\% of variance in 10 components), and used elbow and silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters ($k = 4$). Detailed methodology including PCA results, elbow plots, and silhouette analysis is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:clustering}.

With the optimal number of clusters determined, we examined the cross-linguistic distribution of EDUs across the four identified clusters. Figure~\ref{fig:final_clusters} presents this distribution through three complementary views: absolute counts (left panel), normalised percentages (middle panel), and a heatmap visualisation (right panel). Two clusters exhibit relatively balanced language distribution, containing substantial representation from both German and Russian EDUs—these can be interpreted as cross-linguistically shared discourse patterns. The remaining two clusters show stronger language preferences: one is dominated by Russian EDUs (over 70\% Russian), while another contains a majority of German EDUs.

Chi-square testing confirms that cluster membership and language are significantly associated ($\chi^2$ test, $p < 0.01$), indicating that language identity influences but does not fully determine cluster assignment. Cramér's $V$ indicates a moderate effect size, reflecting the presence of both language-specific and cross-linguistic patterns. This result demonstrates that while certain EDU construction strategies are language-preferential—likely reflecting typological and stylistic differences—other patterns represent universal discourse structuring principles shared across German and Russian.

  \label{fig:final_clusters}
\end{figure}

Finally, we characterised each cluster through comprehensive feature profiling. Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_char} presents four complementary perspectives: a heatmap of standardised feature deviations (top-left), radar charts comparing cluster profiles (top-right), EDU length distributions per cluster (bottom-left), and cluster visualisation in PCA space (bottom-right). For each feature, we computed $z$-scores measuring how many standard deviations each cluster's mean deviates from the global dataset mean. This analysis reveals four distinct EDU pattern archetypes:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Nominal elaboration pattern} – characterised by elevated \texttt{noun\_ratio}, \texttt{adj\_ratio}, and modifier counts. These EDUs are content-dense and descriptive, featuring extensive nominal modification and medium-to-high syntactic depth from embedded noun phrases. This pattern shows a Russian preference, consistent with the language's tendency toward information-packed nominal structures.
  
  \item \textbf{Structural complexity pattern} – marked by above-average \texttt{max\_depth} and \texttt{avg\_dependency\_distance}. These EDUs exhibit deep syntactic embedding and extended linear arrangements, often containing multiple clauses or elaborate modifiers. This cluster is German-preferential, aligning with German's propensity for complex subordinate structures and compound constructions.
  
  \item \textbf{Fragmentary/segmented pattern} – defined by high \texttt{punct\_ratio} coupled with low verb counts and shallow parse depth. These short, often non-clausal units represent list items, titles, or asyndetic constructions with minimal predicative content. Both languages contribute to this cluster, as fragmentary discourse appears across both corpora.
  
  \item \textbf{Predicate–adverbial focus pattern} – distinguished by elevated \texttt{verb\_ratio}, \texttt{finite\_verbs} count, and \texttt{adv\_ratio}. These EDUs center on verbal predicates enriched with adverbial modification, providing detailed circumstantial information. This pattern is more common in German, reflecting the language's frequent use of compound verbal constructions and diverse adverbial elements.
\end{enumerate}

Each cluster's statistical profile—including size, language composition, and distinctive feature patterns—confirms the existence of both cross-linguistic shared strategies and language-specific preferences in EDU construction. This unsupervised discovery of structural archetypes provides empirical grounding for understanding how German and Russian converge and diverge in their discourse-level syntactic organisation.
